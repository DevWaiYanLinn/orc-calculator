#PicCalBot - Calculator app

I would like to express my deep appreciation to Mr. [Thu Rain Soe]. His guidance has been invaluable in helping me understand programming, especially in JavaScript. I owe a lot of my knowledge and skills to his teachings.

## Observation

The app includes optical character recognition (OCR) for accurate input processing through the device's camera.

## features

- **Add (+):** Performs a simple addition operation.
- **Subtraction (-):** Calculates subtraction.
- **Multiplication (×):** Multiply numbers correctly.
